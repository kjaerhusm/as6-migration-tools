"""
Detect legacy mappView WDK (Widget Development Kit) usage.

Rule of thumb:
- Under the project's Logical tree, look for any 'mappView/Widgets' folder.
- If ANY folder at or below that Widgets root contains BOTH a '.js' file and a '.html' file
  in the same folder, the project is considered to be using WDK.
- As soon as we find the first such folder, we stop scanning (performance).

Action:
- Emit a MANDATORY AS6 warning with guidance to migrate to WDTC (Widget Development Tool Chain)
  and provide a link to the B&R community.
